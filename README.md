Projects and ideas for Arduino
These codes are not nessisarilly mine, some have been copied from ardinos websight prodject ideas and other creaters. 
I am using this more as a cloud for backup. 

# AlarmBoxWithLightes.ino
This code is for an arduino uno
in conjuction with a RTC DS3231
It will keep the date and time if set inside the code and sound the alarm for the time in the if statments
the second if statment is for running the lights on the box for one minute after the alarm sounds
The idea is for a alarm that also has a visual componet to wake me up and then stays illuminated untill I can find the light switch.
